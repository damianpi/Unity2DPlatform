# Unity2DPlatform

2D platform made with Unity Engine. It was created as a university project, but looks good. It was created using free assets (sprites, animations, music), together with a few of my scripts + a lot of work to make everything work together. 

The game offers:
* 2 main levels (+1 menu scene),
* Collectibles:
  * Coin - 1 Point
  * Star - 5 points
  * Heart - additional life
* Secrets on every level - stars and coins which together are worth 60 points, 2 hearts,
* Teleports giving you access to normally unreachable areas.
* Spikes, water (Lvl 1) or ground (Lvl 2) decrease the number of your lives.

The menu scene includes a disclaimer pertaining to the assets used. I take no responsibility for any kind of use of this program. My intention is mainly to store my work in this repo. If you'd like to contribute, or somehow use this game, feel free to contact me!
